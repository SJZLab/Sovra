## FTF-0001 — Initialize monorepo
- Criterion ID: FTF-0001
- PR: https://github.com/SJZLab/Sovra/pull/3
- Merge commit: 7ab3f6ff1ac7bcc240e546b764af8d67ae0c8561
- Validated-by: control-plane
- Date: 2026-09-15
- Evidence: GitHub Actions run 34995170054 (job `gate`), conclusion
  success, on the PR's merged head; `product_truth_check.py` 0/0 as
  expected (FTF-0001 claims no proving_symbol — structural layout, not a
  live-wired code path). Full evidence trail in
  docs/certifications/queue.md history for this entry (PR #3) and PR #4
  (unrelated pre-existing workflow-YAML fix required to get real CI
  running on PR #3).

SUPERSEDED — original certification was self-certified (PR #3 and PR #5
share session identity), invalid per Law 4, found by watchdog PR #13,
corrected 2026-09-15.

## FTF-0001 — Initialize monorepo (independent re-certification)
- Criterion ID: FTF-0001
- PR: https://github.com/SJZLab/Sovra/pull/3
- Merge commit: 7ab3f6ff1ac7bcc240e546b764af8d67ae0c8561
- Validated-by: session https://claude.ai/code/session_01Rs3uk7ApCoUpnFb9hHS9Uz
  (session-ID comparison performed and recorded before this entry: this
  session's ID does not match PR #3/PR #5's session
  session_01EN6u2CfDd8VdrHDTNyuH4g, nor watchdog PR #13's session
  session_01Y7WHsvr6Xi1RnUnkifEyRZ — independent of both the original
  producer/self-certifier and the watchdog that found the finding)
- Date: 2026-09-15
- Evidence independently re-verified this session, not taken on the
  original ledger entry's word:
  1. Read PR #3's full file diff (`get_files`) — 20 files, all scaffolding
     (root pnpm/uv workspace config, seven component dirs each with
     README + manifest, tests/test_ftf_0001_monorepo_layout.py); matches
     the committed description, nothing beyond FTF-0001's own scope.
  2. Fetched GitHub Actions run 34995170054 directly via the Actions API
     (not the PR body's claim about it): workflow `CI`, event
     `pull_request`, status `completed`, conclusion `success`, real actor
     `samerzakaria`, head_sha `2f63b7f` — a genuine run, not a 0-job parse
     failure.
  3. Ran `tests/test_ftf_0001_monorepo_layout.py` locally against the
     current tree: passes clean (0 failures). Then fault-injected by
     removing `apps/api/pyproject.toml` and re-ran: test correctly
     reddens (`FAIL [FTF-0001] apps/api/pyproject.toml exists`, exit 1) —
     confirms the test can actually fail, not just always pass. File
     restored, re-ran clean again.
  4. Confirmed `product_truth_check.py`'s `0/0 product-true` is legitimate
     for this criterion: `docs/spec-matrix.yaml`'s FTF-0001 entry has
     `proving_symbol: ''` (structural layout, no live-wired code path
     claimed), which is the one case CONTROL_PLANE_MODES.md's CERTIFY
     step 4 says 0/0 is a valid pass rather than an unwired claim.
- Conclusion: the underlying L1 evidence holds up under independent
  re-verification — the prior entry's defect was procedural
  (self-certification), not substantive. Re-certified L2-CERTIFIED.

## FTF-0002 — Add formatting/lint/type checks
- Criterion ID: FTF-0002
- PR: https://github.com/SJZLab/Sovra/pull/23
- Merge commit: 41f1493bca4f70aa74ab61516d1a22ee197daf79
- Validated-by: session https://claude.ai/code/session_01DY5FK4nK2VLrUMKHwNQQU2
  (session-ID comparison performed and recorded before this entry: both
  commits on PR #23 — e3f0c1a981db04bd5d16078f5fd72fcebfc866c7 and
  6928d1437264d7b5efa530cdd07861f8f72bd21b — carry
  `Claude-Session: .../session_01NuAjwmK5rwuxefyo5L7zgy`; this session's ID
  does not match, so this is an independent certification, not
  self-certification)
- Date: 2026-09-16
- Evidence independently re-verified this session, not taken on the PR
  description's word:
  1. Read the full diff (`git show e3f0c1a`) and every changed config file
     (`pyproject.toml`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `tsconfig*.json`,
     `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — confirmed no `continue-on-error`, no
     softened severity, and the only exclusion (`tools/r1_handoff.py`,
     from ruff+mypy) is a documented, narrow exception to keep that file
     byte-identical to the master spec's own Section 86 — not a
     production-code exclusion.
  2. Ran `uv sync` and `pnpm install` from a clean state independently
     (not reusing the producer's environment) — both succeeded, confirming
     the pre-existing `hatchling`/`uv sync` defect fix actually holds.
  3. Ran `tests/tasks/test_ftf_0002.py` myself: all 6 checks pass fresh.
  4. Fetched GitHub Actions run 35070915230 directly via the Actions API:
     workflow `CI`, event `pull_request`, head_sha
     `6928d1437264d7b5efa530cdd07861f8f72bd21b` (confirmed via
     `pull_request_read` to be PR #23's actual merged head), conclusion
     `success` — a genuine run, not a 0-job parse failure. `ci.yml` only
     triggers on `pull_request`, so there is no separate push-triggered
     run on the merge commit to cross-check — expected, not a gap.
  5. Performed my own fault injection rather than trusting the commit
     message's claim: appended `import os` to the real, tracked
     `scripts/status.py`, ran the unmodified `ruff check .` — genuine
     failure (`F401` + `E402`, exit 1). Reverted (`git checkout --`),
     re-ran — clean (exit 0, `All checks passed!`). Confirmed zero leftover
     diff before moving on.
  6. Ran `python3 scripts/product_truth_check.py --fail-on-unwired`:
     `0/0 product-true`, exit 0 — legitimate per CONTROL_PLANE_MODES.md
     CERTIFY step 4, since `docs/spec-matrix.yaml`'s FTF-0002 entry has
     `proving_symbol: ''` (CI tooling, not a live product-runtime path).
  7. Pulled the real contract via
     `python tools/r1_handoff.py packet FTF-0002 --plan FINE_TUNING_FACTORY_RELEASE_1.md`
     and checked the delivered work against it, not just "tests pass":
     acceptance ("deliberately introduce formatting/lint/type defects for
     Python and TS; each required command exits nonzero") — met, shown in
     both the test file's fixtures and my own manual injection above;
     negative_acceptance ("no exclusion of production package, altered
     severity or continue-on-error to bypass a failing tool") — met, per
     item 1. The packet's `verification_commands`
     (`scripts/validate_spec.py`, `scripts/verify_task.py`) don't exist
     yet — expected, per the packet's own text: those are gated behind
     FTF-H001's verification-map bootstrap, and until then FTF-0001/2/3
     use direct pinned commands with captured raw output, which is what
     this task actually did.
- Conclusion: L1 evidence holds up under independent re-verification —
  fresh install, fresh test run, fresh fault injection, real CI on the
  actual merged head, and the delivered work matches the real contract's
  acceptance/negative_acceptance clauses. Certified L2-CERTIFIED.

## FTF-0003 — Add test harnesses
- Criterion ID: FTF-0003
- PR: https://github.com/SJZLab/Sovra/pull/26
- Merge commit: e2c2dae96142c95a78005fd7528df6ac7e3e5dfc
- Validated-by: session https://claude.ai/code/session_018gZRsspGdmcTmtxkqRDE59
  (session-ID comparison performed and recorded before this entry: both
  commits on PR #26 — d4482de2cbcdda17000f059886c47b894b680830 and
  678285f1a5d69b0453b3ed630da5603c740734c2 — carry
  `Claude-Session: .../session_01DY5FK4nK2VLrUMKHwNQQU2`; this session's ID
  does not match, so this is an independent certification, not
  self-certification)
- Date: 2026-09-16
- Evidence independently re-verified this session, not taken on the PR
  description's word:
  1. Read the full PR diff (19 files changed) and the CI workflow change —
     confirmed no `continue-on-error`, no softened severity; the harness
     is wired into `.github/workflows/ci.yml` as real required steps, not
     appended after the gate.
  2. Ran `uv sync` and `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` from a clean git
     worktree checked out at the actual merge commit (`e2c2dae`, not the
     producer's branch or environment) — both succeeded fresh.
  3. Ran the real CI commands myself: `uv run pytest tests/unit
     --junitxml=... -ra` (3 passed) and `pnpm exec vitest run
     --reporter=junit --outputFile=...` (2 passed), then
     `scripts/check_test_harness.py` against both reports — exit 0,
     "all reports clean". Then ran `tests/tasks/test_ftf_0003.py` itself —
     "all checks passed".
  4. Fetched GitHub Actions run 35083644711 directly via the Actions API
     (not the PR body's claim): workflow `CI`, event `pull_request`,
     head_sha `678285f1a5d69b0453b3ed630da5603c740734c2` (PR #26's actual
     merged head), conclusion `success` — a genuine run, not a 0-job parse
     failure.
  5. Performed my own fault injection, independent of the PR's claimed
     evidence, against the checked-out merge commit: (a) ran
     `check_test_harness.py` against an empty pytest dir's JUnit
     output — genuine "zero collected tests" failure, exit 1; (b) added a
     real `pytest.mark.skip` fixture — genuine "skipped/focused test(s)"
     failure, exit 1; (c) added a real Vitest `test.only` fixture — same
     genuine failure, exit 1. All three reverted; working tree confirmed
     clean afterward. This reproduces the negative_acceptance clause
     first-hand rather than trusting the commit message's description of
     it.
  6. Ran `python3 scripts/product_truth_check.py --fail-on-unwired`:
     `0/0 product-true`, exit 0 — legitimate per
     CONTROL_PLANE_MODES.md CERTIFY step 4, since `docs/spec-matrix.yaml`'s
     FTF-0003 entry has `proving_symbol: ''` (test-harness tooling, not a
     live product-runtime path). Also ran `scripts/status.py` — consistent
     pre-certification count (2/300).
  7. Re-ran the full pre-existing gate (`ruff check`, `ruff format
     --check`, `mypy`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run format:check`, `pnpm run
     typecheck`) on the checked-out merge commit — all still pass clean,
     confirming FTF-0003 introduced no regression to FTF-0002's certified
     evidence. Confirmed `tests/test_ftf_0001_monorepo_layout.py` and
     `tests/tasks/test_ftf_0002.py` are untouched by this PR's diff
     (absent from the 19 changed files) — no Law 15 requalification
     question for either's existing certified evidence.
  8. Pulled the real contract via `python tools/r1_handoff.py packet
     FTF-0003 --plan FINE_TUNING_FACTORY_RELEASE_1.md` and checked the
     delivered work against it, not just "tests pass": acceptance clause 1
     ("harnesses collect real assertions and publish machine-readable
     counts") — met, shown by the JUnit XML output above; acceptance
     clause 2 ("independent review... recorded") — met by this entry;
     negative_acceptance ("zero collected tests, focused .only or skipped
     required test must fail validation; remove template sample tests")
     — met, per item 5, and the two new `.test.ts` files plus
     `test_product_truth_check_helpers.py` each test a real (if trivial)
     existing constant/function, not template filler. The packet's
     `verification_commands` (`scripts/validate_spec.py`,
     `scripts/verify_task.py`) still don't exist in the checked-out tree
     — expected and already established at FTF-0002's certification:
     gated behind FTF-H001's verification-map bootstrap, not a new gap
     introduced by this task. The packet's suggested single file
     (`apps/api/app/config/add_test_harnesses.py`) was not created;
     the packet's own text says initial file paths are not binding and
     path refinement is allowed, and the delivered layout (harness
     configs + a shared gate script + task-evidence test) is the coherent
     structure for two-language test tooling, not a scattered
     one-file-per-ticket approach the packet explicitly warns against.
- Conclusion: L1 evidence holds up under independent re-verification on a
  freshly checked-out copy of the actual merge commit — fresh install,
  fresh test run, three independent fault injections (not the producer's),
  real CI on the actual merged head, no regression to prior certified
  evidence, and the delivered work matches the real contract's
  acceptance/negative_acceptance clauses. Certified L2-CERTIFIED.

## FTF-0005 — Configuration system (repr secret-redaction fix, re-review)
- Criterion ID: FTF-0005
- PR: https://github.com/SJZLab/Sovra/pull/30
- Merge commit: 5f5a34d803a76e3261c8cc860bd5f21cd8290424
- Validated-by: session https://claude.ai/code/session_01QkKmTi2Lb9kQTCcjGFwpQQ
  (session-ID comparison performed and recorded before this entry: both
  commits on PR #30 — 9f2dcbca6866871bf17edf68ea02fed7b61748ad and
  65824c56879b80e012f19c4b4f9b9e8b0098f5fe — carry
  `Claude-Session: .../session_012mAtoqKYzA7PiXbkGkD7rY`, the same
  producer session as the original PR #28; this session's ID does not
  match either, so this is an independent certification, not
  self-certification)
- Date: 2026-09-16
- Background: an earlier independent Control-plane session
  (`session_01WjQKEb87DwDx51YLNRxT6o`, PR #29) reviewed the original
  FTF-0005 delivery (PR #28) and did NOT certify it — `Settings.__repr__`
  redacted `database_url`'s embedded userinfo via `_redact_url()` but
  interpolated `litellm_gateway_url` raw, so an *accepted* gateway URL
  with embedded credentials (valid in any environment including
  production) had its password echoed verbatim by `repr(settings)`. That
  finding is recorded in `docs/certifications/queue.md` and stayed
  PROVISIONAL, not downgraded further, per that review's own scoping. PR
  #30 is the producer's scoped fix for exactly that defect.
- Evidence independently re-verified this session, not taken on the PR
  description's word:
  1. Read the actual diff (`git show 9f2dcbc -- apps/api/app/config/configuration_system.py`):
     exactly one line changed — `litellm_gateway_url` now passes through
     `_redact_url()` in `__repr__`, mirroring the existing `database_url`
     line immediately above it. No other file's production code touched.
  2. Fetched GitHub Actions run 35087235376 directly via the Actions API:
     workflow `CI`, event `pull_request`, head_sha
     `65824c56879b80e012f19c4b4f9b9e8b0098f5fe` (confirmed via
     `pull_request_read` to be PR #30's actual merged head), conclusion
     `success` — a genuine run tied to the real merged commit, not a
     stale or self-reported claim.
  3. Ran `tests/tasks/test_ftf_0005.py` on a fresh checkout of the actual
     merge commit (`5f5a34d`): all 10 checks pass.
  4. Performed my own fault injection, independent of the PR's claimed
     evidence: reverted the redaction on the checked-out merge commit
     (restored `f"litellm_gateway_url={self.litellm_gateway_url!r}, "`
     with no `_redact_url()` call) and re-ran the test — genuine failure,
     exactly the defect PR #29 originally found:
     `FAIL [FTF-0005] an accepted gateway URL's embedded password never
     appears in Settings' repr`. Restored the fix from a pre-edit backup
     copy, confirmed `git diff` empty (byte-identical), re-ran clean
     (10/10 pass again). This reproduces both the original defect and the
     fix's effectiveness first-hand rather than trusting the commit
     message's description of it.
  5. Ran `python3 scripts/product_truth_check.py --fail-on-unwired`:
     `0/0 product-true`, exit 0 — legitimate per
     CONTROL_PLANE_MODES.md CERTIFY step 4, since `docs/spec-matrix.yaml`'s
     FTF-0005 entry has `proving_symbol: ''` (no live caller yet — no
     `apps/api/app/main.py` wires this module into a running service;
     unchanged from the original PR #28 review).
  6. Pulled the real contract via `python tools/r1_handoff.py packet
     FTF-0005 --plan FINE_TUNING_FACTORY_RELEASE_1.md` and checked the
     fix against it, not just "tests pass": negative_acceptance ("No
     development fallback credentials or production tls_verify=false;
     sensitive values absent from errors") — the `__repr__` leak this fix
     closes is exactly the "sensitive values absent" surface the original
     delivery's own docstring and `__repr__` comment already claimed to
     meet but did not for this one field; now genuinely met, confirmed by
     item 4 above. The other acceptance clause ("Typed settings reject
     missing/invalid URLs, policy enum, budget and secret refs") and the
     remaining nine checks in `tests/tasks/test_ftf_0005.py` were
     unchanged by this scoped fix and were already independently
     evaluated during the PR #28/#29 review cycle — not re-litigated
     here, per that review's own scoping note that "this is a scoped fix,
     not a redo."
  7. CLAUDE.md integrity: `sha256sum CLAUDE.md` matches the committed
     `CLAUDE.md.sha256` — no drift.
- Conclusion: the fix is minimal, exactly matches what the prior
  independent review specified, is proven by a fault injection that
  reproduces the original defect and shows the fix closes it, and CI ran
  for real on the actual merged head. Certified L2-CERTIFIED.
- Note for next Control-plane/relay session: a separate, later branch
  (`claude/wizardly-fermat-3mh1pd`, opened as PR #31 after PR #30 had
  already merged) contains an independent, functionally identical fix for
  the same defect, produced by a different producer session
  (`session_01NV9ZvW9ptNnx8RzFWUoZQi`) that was apparently unaware PR #30
  had already landed. PR #31 is now stale/duplicate and shows
  `mergeable_state: dirty` against current `main` — this certification
  entry is not touching or closing it (out of scope for CERTIFY mode);
  flagging only so it isn't mistaken for still-open work on an
  uncertified defect.
