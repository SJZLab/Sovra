## FTF-0001 — Initialize monorepo
- Criterion ID: FTF-0001
- PR: https://github.com/SJZLab/Sovra/pull/3
- Merge commit: 7ab3f6ff1ac7bcc240e546b764af8d67ae0c8561
- Validated-by: control-plane
- Date: 2026-09-15
- Evidence: GitHub Actions run 34995170054 (job `gate`), conclusion
  success, on the PR's merged head; `product_truth_check.py` 0/0 as
  expected (FTF-0001 claims no proving_symbol — structural layout, not a
  live-wired code path). Full evidence trail in
  docs/certifications/queue.md history for this entry (PR #3) and PR #4
  (unrelated pre-existing workflow-YAML fix required to get real CI
  running on PR #3).

SUPERSEDED — original certification was self-certified (PR #3 and PR #5
share session identity), invalid per Law 4, found by watchdog PR #13,
corrected 2026-09-15.

## FTF-0001 — Initialize monorepo (independent re-certification)
- Criterion ID: FTF-0001
- PR: https://github.com/SJZLab/Sovra/pull/3
- Merge commit: 7ab3f6ff1ac7bcc240e546b764af8d67ae0c8561
- Validated-by: session https://claude.ai/code/session_01Rs3uk7ApCoUpnFb9hHS9Uz
  (session-ID comparison performed and recorded before this entry: this
  session's ID does not match PR #3/PR #5's session
  session_01EN6u2CfDd8VdrHDTNyuH4g, nor watchdog PR #13's session
  session_01Y7WHsvr6Xi1RnUnkifEyRZ — independent of both the original
  producer/self-certifier and the watchdog that found the finding)
- Date: 2026-09-15
- Evidence independently re-verified this session, not taken on the
  original ledger entry's word:
  1. Read PR #3's full file diff (`get_files`) — 20 files, all scaffolding
     (root pnpm/uv workspace config, seven component dirs each with
     README + manifest, tests/test_ftf_0001_monorepo_layout.py); matches
     the committed description, nothing beyond FTF-0001's own scope.
  2. Fetched GitHub Actions run 34995170054 directly via the Actions API
     (not the PR body's claim about it): workflow `CI`, event
     `pull_request`, status `completed`, conclusion `success`, real actor
     `samerzakaria`, head_sha `2f63b7f` — a genuine run, not a 0-job parse
     failure.
  3. Ran `tests/test_ftf_0001_monorepo_layout.py` locally against the
     current tree: passes clean (0 failures). Then fault-injected by
     removing `apps/api/pyproject.toml` and re-ran: test correctly
     reddens (`FAIL [FTF-0001] apps/api/pyproject.toml exists`, exit 1) —
     confirms the test can actually fail, not just always pass. File
     restored, re-ran clean again.
  4. Confirmed `product_truth_check.py`'s `0/0 product-true` is legitimate
     for this criterion: `docs/spec-matrix.yaml`'s FTF-0001 entry has
     `proving_symbol: ''` (structural layout, no live-wired code path
     claimed), which is the one case CONTROL_PLANE_MODES.md's CERTIFY
     step 4 says 0/0 is a valid pass rather than an unwired claim.
- Conclusion: the underlying L1 evidence holds up under independent
  re-verification — the prior entry's defect was procedural
  (self-certification), not substantive. Re-certified L2-CERTIFIED.

## FTF-0002 — Add formatting/lint/type checks
- Criterion ID: FTF-0002
- PR: https://github.com/SJZLab/Sovra/pull/23
- Merge commit: 41f1493bca4f70aa74ab61516d1a22ee197daf79
- Validated-by: session https://claude.ai/code/session_01DY5FK4nK2VLrUMKHwNQQU2
  (session-ID comparison performed and recorded before this entry: both
  commits on PR #23 — e3f0c1a981db04bd5d16078f5fd72fcebfc866c7 and
  6928d1437264d7b5efa530cdd07861f8f72bd21b — carry
  `Claude-Session: .../session_01NuAjwmK5rwuxefyo5L7zgy`; this session's ID
  does not match, so this is an independent certification, not
  self-certification)
- Date: 2026-09-16
- Evidence independently re-verified this session, not taken on the PR
  description's word:
  1. Read the full diff (`git show e3f0c1a`) and every changed config file
     (`pyproject.toml`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `tsconfig*.json`,
     `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — confirmed no `continue-on-error`, no
     softened severity, and the only exclusion (`tools/r1_handoff.py`,
     from ruff+mypy) is a documented, narrow exception to keep that file
     byte-identical to the master spec's own Section 86 — not a
     production-code exclusion.
  2. Ran `uv sync` and `pnpm install` from a clean state independently
     (not reusing the producer's environment) — both succeeded, confirming
     the pre-existing `hatchling`/`uv sync` defect fix actually holds.
  3. Ran `tests/tasks/test_ftf_0002.py` myself: all 6 checks pass fresh.
  4. Fetched GitHub Actions run 35070915230 directly via the Actions API:
     workflow `CI`, event `pull_request`, head_sha
     `6928d1437264d7b5efa530cdd07861f8f72bd21b` (confirmed via
     `pull_request_read` to be PR #23's actual merged head), conclusion
     `success` — a genuine run, not a 0-job parse failure. `ci.yml` only
     triggers on `pull_request`, so there is no separate push-triggered
     run on the merge commit to cross-check — expected, not a gap.
  5. Performed my own fault injection rather than trusting the commit
     message's claim: appended `import os` to the real, tracked
     `scripts/status.py`, ran the unmodified `ruff check .` — genuine
     failure (`F401` + `E402`, exit 1). Reverted (`git checkout --`),
     re-ran — clean (exit 0, `All checks passed!`). Confirmed zero leftover
     diff before moving on.
  6. Ran `python3 scripts/product_truth_check.py --fail-on-unwired`:
     `0/0 product-true`, exit 0 — legitimate per CONTROL_PLANE_MODES.md
     CERTIFY step 4, since `docs/spec-matrix.yaml`'s FTF-0002 entry has
     `proving_symbol: ''` (CI tooling, not a live product-runtime path).
  7. Pulled the real contract via
     `python tools/r1_handoff.py packet FTF-0002 --plan FINE_TUNING_FACTORY_RELEASE_1.md`
     and checked the delivered work against it, not just "tests pass":
     acceptance ("deliberately introduce formatting/lint/type defects for
     Python and TS; each required command exits nonzero") — met, shown in
     both the test file's fixtures and my own manual injection above;
     negative_acceptance ("no exclusion of production package, altered
     severity or continue-on-error to bypass a failing tool") — met, per
     item 1. The packet's `verification_commands`
     (`scripts/validate_spec.py`, `scripts/verify_task.py`) don't exist
     yet — expected, per the packet's own text: those are gated behind
     FTF-H001's verification-map bootstrap, and until then FTF-0001/2/3
     use direct pinned commands with captured raw output, which is what
     this task actually did.
- Conclusion: L1 evidence holds up under independent re-verification —
  fresh install, fresh test run, fresh fault injection, real CI on the
  actual merged head, and the delivered work matches the real contract's
  acceptance/negative_acceptance clauses. Certified L2-CERTIFIED.
